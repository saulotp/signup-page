This was my first challenge from "dailyUI".

The challenge consists in:

"Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. "

Then. . . .

With my basics knowledge on web-dev, I built a very simple sign up page with some functionalites about focus and hover:

HOVER: the form container is dark, then when mouse pass above some input, background-color changes the color to white. This function possibility a better vision where click.

FOCUS: When user writing something on input, the text-color appears as black, but when user click on anyother input, text-color changes to white for a better contrast with form background-color.

that's all for now.

Contact me for any suggestions or help me to improve my DEV skills I will love it <3
